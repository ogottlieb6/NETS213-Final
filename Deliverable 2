Your repository must contain a data/ directory. For now, this should contain the following:
Raw data input that your project requires. If your project needs inputs like Tweets about HPV, pictures of celebrities wearing stylings threads, or psycholinguistic stimuli, then spend time gathering a set of these inputs. You don’t need the whole dataset, but have enough to be able to get a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) of your idea working.

Sample Result of Running HIT #1: Selected Keyword by the crowd: “Love”
 

Eventually you’ll be gathering real data from the crowd. Before that happens you should create fake data that you can use as input for the initial implementation of your modules. Create a data subsection of your README file that describes the format. Ideally the format will be reusable when you get real data from your workers. That way you only have to change your input files, and your algorithms can operate as they did before.
HIT #2 and #3: 
Create a 4 line stanza following an alternating rhyme scheme
Input: “Love” kEYWORKD 
Run Quality control algorithms on each inputted stanza to count syllables, check for duplicate lines
Take inputted stanzas and run them through a separate HIT to find most popular quatrain to serve as the first stanza of the sonnet 
Sample Stanza:
True love takes shape as a strongest fire,
In the mind forever burning away,
Never sick, never dead, never cold or tire,
I stand to the side; my response is to pray 

HIT #4 and #5: 
Create a 4 line stanza following an alternating rhyme scheme
Input: Result from HIT #3 (Aggregated sonnet up till now) 
Run QC control same as above
Get stanza that is voted on by a majority of the workers (outputted below)
Sample Stanza:
Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

HIT #6 and #7: 
Create a 4 line stanza following an alternating rhyme scheme
Input: Aggregated Result from HIT #3, #5
Run QC control same as above
Get stanza that is voted on by a majority of the workers (outputted below)
Sample Stanza:
All this pain, still I want her here and now 
My heart aches for her, my heart calls for her 
Lest, she is gone, I’m left wondering how
Memories here that will soon be a blur  
HIT #8 and #9: 
Create a 2 line couplet following an alternating rhyme scheme
Input: Aggregated Result from HIT #3, #5, #7
Run QC control same as above
Get couplet that is voted on by a majority of the workers (outputted below)
Sample Stanza:
Love oh love is a complicated thing
But love oh love has a beautiful zing

Final Aggregated Sonet based on all prior HITS: 
True love takes shape as a strongest fire,
In the mind forever burning away,
Never sick, never dead, never cold or tire,
I stand to the side; my response is to pray 

Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

All this pain, still I want her here and now 
My heart aches for her, my heart calls for her 
Lest, she is gone, I’m left wondering how
Memories here that will soon be a blur  

Love oh love is a complicated thing
But love oh love has a beautiful zing

Brief Explanation of Aggregation Process: At each set of HITS, the status of our sonnet changes. At HITS #1 and #2, we input just the keyword, allowing turkers to set the framework for what will become the first quatrain. The most popular quatrain as outputted in HIT #2 is then fed into HIT #3 as how much of the sonnet is currently complete. We continue this iterative process of growing the sonnet until we reach the couplet at which point our sonnet is done. 


Sample QC Inputs and Outputs: 

Our QC algorithm will receive a selection of sonnet stanzas from the workers and it will only move the stanza through if it fits the following criteria: 
Each line has 10 syllables
No duplicate lines and 4 total lines
The stanzas follow an alternating rhyme scheme while the couplet follows a AA rhyme scheme
Sample Inputs:

	Input 1:

	What is the meaning of love
	Love is a complicated thing 
	Love is like a dove
	Love has a great zing
	

	Input 2:

	Love is an essential part of life
	Love is an essential part of life

	Input 3:

	Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

Output:
	Input 3:

	Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

Sample Aggregation Module Inputs and Outputs: 

Our aggregation module will work using majority vote, where for all the valid stanzas, workers will vote on them and we will use a majority vote algorithm to get the stanza with the most votes. This stanza will be appended onto our sonnet.
Sample Inputs:

	Input 1:

	(25% votes for Input 1)

	True love takes shape as a strongest fire,
In the mind forever burning away,
Never sick, never dead, never cold or tire,
I stand to the side; my response is to pray 
	

	Input 2:

	(35% votes for Input 1)

	All this pain, still I want her here and now 
My heart aches for her, my heart calls for her 
Lest, she is gone, I’m left wondering how
Memories here that will soon be a blur  

	Input 3:

	(40% votes for Input 3)

	Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

Output:
	Input 3:

(40% votes for Input 3)

	Love oh love why is it needed so much
Oh life would be simple without love’s pains
Love oh love it should not be such a sludge
But I do love thee and I can’t abstain

Reasoning: Input 3 has the highest vote count so our aggregation module will output input 3 and append it to our sonnet.
