# NETS213-FinalReadMe for Final Project - Part 2

Major Components:

Aggregate List of Keywords: In the first part of the project we will be creating a list of possible keywords to be the general topic of the Sonnet. Some examples of these keywords could include food, love, Philadelphia, etc. We will manually choose around 15 keywords. 

Milestones:
Create the list of words by meeting together and choosing the best topics we see fit

HIIT 1: Rank keywords to determine the Sonnet topic: We will then create the first HIIT, where people will rank the sonnet topics. This will be sent out to around 20 people. This will allow us to crowdsource the ranks for the topics to be able to choose the best possible topic for our Sonnet. We will use the best-ranked topic for our Sonnet. 

Milestones:
Create the HIIT instructions, design, and price per HIIT
Submit the HIIT onto Mechanical Turk
Aggregate the results and choose the HIIT with the best score

HIIT 2: Create a 4 Line Stanza Following an Alternating Rhyme Scheme: We will then create the second HIIT, where people will create a 4 line stanza following an alternating rhyme scheme around the topic chosen in HIIT 1 where every line has to have 10 syllables. This HIIT will be completed by around 50 people. We will then aggregate the results from the 50 workers, and so we will have 50 distinct 4 line stanzas surrounding the topic from HIIT 1.

Milestones:
Create the HIIT instructions, design, and price per HIIT
Submit the HIIT onto Mechanical Turk
Aggregate the results of the HIIT

Quality Control: Use Python Code to Count Syllables, Check for Duplicate Lines, and Check for Correct Rhyme Scheme: We will then run the aggregated results through 3 pieces of Python code. The first will analyze all the HIIT’s and count the syllables in each line to make sure it follows the requirement of 10 syllables per line for a Sonnet. We will then run the HIIT 2 results through another piece of code that checks for duplicate lines, as well as another piece of code that checks for the correct rhyme scheme. We will discard the HIITs that do not pass all three requirements. We will then aggregate the HIIT results that pass all 3 requirements. 

Milestones:
Create code for Quality Control that counts syllables, checks for duplicate lines, and checks for correct rhyme scheme
Run the code on the aggregated HIIT 2 results
Aggregate the HIIT 2 results that pass all 3 quality control tests

HIIT 3: Crowd Votes on Stanzas Based on Content and Relevance to Keywords: We will then create our third HIIT, where the crowd will vote on the stanzas that passed the QC tests. The crowd will be given instructions to choose the best stanza based on the content and relevance to the specific keyword. This HIIT will be completed by around 50 people. Aggregate the results from the 50 workers. 

Milestones:
Create the HIIT instructions, design, and price per HIIT
Submit the HIIT onto Mechanical Turk
Aggregate the results of the HIIT

Aggregation: The Winning 4 Lines are Appended to the Poem and the Process is Repeated: We will then aggregate the results from the 3rd HIIT, and choose the stanza with the highest number of votes. This stanza will be appended to our sonnet. We will then repeat steps 3-6 three times to build a preliminary sonnet 12 lines long. 

Milestones:
Aggregate results from previous HIIT and choose stanza with highest votes
Append stanza to sonnet
Repeat steps 3-6

HIIT 4: Create a 2 Line Couplet to Best Conclude the Sonnet: We will create our 4th HIIT where the workers will be presented with the 10 line preliminary sonnet and their job is to create two lines that best conclude the sonnet, keeping into account the rhyming and syllables requirements. This HIIT will also be completed by around 50 workers. Aggregate the results from the 50 workers. 

Milestones:
Create the HIIT instructions, design, and price per HIIT
Make sure the HIIT includes the preliminary 10 line sonnet that we created
Submit the HIIT onto Mechanical Turk
Aggregate the results of the HIIT

Quality Control: Use Python Code to Count Syllables, Check for Duplicate Lines, and Check for Correct Rhyme Scheme: We will then run the aggregated results through 3 pieces of Python code. The first will analyze all the HIIT’s and count the syllables in each line to make sure it follows the requirement of 10 syllables per line for a Sonnet. We will then run the HIIT 2 results through another piece of code that checks for duplicate lines, as well as another piece of code that checks for the correct rhyme scheme. We will discard the HIITs that do not pass all three requirements. We will then aggregate the HIIT results that pass all 3 requirements. 

Milestones:
Use code for Quality Control that counts syllables, checks for duplicate lines, and checks for correct rhyme scheme from step 4
Run the code on the aggregated HIIT 4 results
Aggregate the HIIT 4 results that pass all 3 quality control tests

HIIT 5: Crowd Votes on Best Couplet Based on Content, Cohesion, and Relevance to Keywords: We will then create our fifth HIIT, where the crowd will vote on the best couplet that passed the QC tests. The crowd will be given instructions to choose the best couplet based on the content and relevance to the specific keyword. The cohesion of the couplet with the rest of the sonnet should also be taken into account by the workers. This HIIT will be completed by around 50 people. Aggregate the results from the 50 workers. 

Milestones:
Create the HIIT instructions, design, and price per HIIT
Submit the HIIT onto Mechanical Turk
Aggregate the results of the HIIT

Aggregation: The Winning Couplet is Appended to the Poem: We will then aggregate the results from the 5th HIIT, and choose the coupley with the highest number of votes. This couplet will be appended to our sonnet. We now have a fully finished sonnet using the power of the crowd!

Milestones:
Aggregate results from previous HIIT and choose couplet with highest votes
Append couplet to sonnet
